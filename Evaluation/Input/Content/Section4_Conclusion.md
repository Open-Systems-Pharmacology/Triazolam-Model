The final triazolam PBPK model applies metabolism by CYP3A4, modelled as two separate pathways yielding Î±-hydroxy-triazolam and 4-hydroxy-triazolam as metabolites. Overall, the model adequately describes the observed PK of triazolam in healthy, non-obese adults receiving different single IV or PO doses of triazolam. The model is deemed fit for purpose to be applied as victim drug for the investigation of CYP3A4 drug-drug interactions.
