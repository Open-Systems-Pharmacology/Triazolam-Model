The PBPK model for triazolam was developed and verified with clinical PK data.

The next sections show:

1. the final model parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-final-input-parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building: [Section 3.3](#33-concentration-time-profiles).
