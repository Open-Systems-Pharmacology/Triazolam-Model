The presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of a PBPK model for triazolam in healthy adults.

Triazolam, sold under the trade name Halcion, among others, belongs to the group of benzodiazepines and is used for short-term treatment of insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. It is generally administered orally as immediate release tablet, but other forms of administrations, e.g. intravenously or as sublingual tablet, exist as well.

Following oral administration, triazolam is rapidly absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of 44 ± 24% (mean ± standard deviation, [Kroboth 1995](#5-references)). Triazolam is widely distributed throughout the body. Its fraction unbound in human plasma averages around 17% and is, within the range of 20 to 1000 ng/mL, not influenced by total triazolam concentrations ([Eberts 1981](#5-references)). Triazolam is extensively metabolized via CYP3A4 to α-hydroxy-alprazolam and 4-hydroxy-alprazolam ([Eberts 1981](#5-references), [Kronbach 1989](#5-references)) and is therefore often used as victim compound in drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies.

The presented triazolam PBPK model was developed for intravenous (IV) administration and oral (PO) administration of the immediate release tablet given in fasted state in healthy, non-obese adults.
