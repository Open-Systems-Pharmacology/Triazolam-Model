This repository contains:

- a [PK-Sim snapshot (*.json) file](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/working-with-pk-sim/pk-sim-documentation/importing-exporting-project-data-models#exporting-project-to-snapshot-loading-project-from-snapshot) of the current PBPK model
- static content (e.g. text blocks, *.md files) as inputs for an evaluation plan
- an evaluation plan (evaluation-plan.json) to create an evaluation report using the snapshot and static text blocks to display the performance of the model

**The latest release of the snapshot of the model, the evaluation plan and the static content can be found [here](../../releases/latest).**

**The latest release of the PK-Sim project model file and the respective evaluation report can be found [here](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSP-PBPK-Model-Library/releases/latest).**



This triazolam model is intended to be used as victim drug in CYP3A4-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDI).

This whole-body PBPK model of triazolam has been developed based on clinical data obtained from the literature for intravenous (IV) administration and oral (PO) administration of the immediate release tablet given in fasted state in healthy, non-obese adults. In total, 20 clinical studies were used for model development and evaluation. Further information can be found [here](../../releases/latest).
